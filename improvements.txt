My Top 3 Recommendations:

Real-time log streaming - Most requested feature
Resource alerts - Critical for VPS monitoring
Container search - Essential for many containers

Would you like me to implement any of these? I'd suggest starting with search/filter + resource alerts as they're high-impact and relatively straightforward! 🎯
